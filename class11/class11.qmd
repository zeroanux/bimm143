**Q13:** Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
csv <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```

```{r}
table(csv$geno)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

exp1 <- csv %>%
  filter(geno == "A/A")
median(exp1$exp)

exp2 <- csv %>%
  filter(geno == "A/G")
median(exp2$exp)

exp3 <- csv %>%
  filter(geno == "G/G")
median(exp3$exp)
```

**Q14:** Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(csv) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

Having G/G is associated with the reduced expression of ORMDL3 compared to A/A.

The SNP effects the expression of ORMDL3.
