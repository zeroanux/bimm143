# Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

## PDB statistics

```{r}
des <- "Data Export Summary.csv"
des.df <- read.csv(des, row.names=1)
```

**Q1:** What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
ncX.ray <- as.numeric(gsub(',', '', des.df$X.ray))
ncEM <- as.numeric(gsub(',', '', des.df$EM))
ncTotal <- as.numeric(gsub(',', '', des.df$Total))

p_xray <- sum(ncX.ray) / sum(ncTotal) * 100
p_xray
p_em <- sum(ncEM) / sum(ncTotal) * 100
p_em
p_total = p_xray + p_em
p_total
```

**Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
total_protein <- as.numeric(gsub(',', '', des.df[1, 7]))

total_protein / sum(ncTotal) * 100
```

**Q3:** Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

951

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

**Q4**: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Water molecules are represented by O atoms.

**Q5**: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

It's HOH 306.

**Q6**: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb('1hsg')
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Predicting functional motions of a single structure by NMA

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
adk
```

**Q7:** How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

**Q8:** Name one of the two non-protein residues?

HOH, MK1

**Q9:** How many protein chains are in this structure?

2

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
class(m)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

```{r}
library(bio3d)
library(devtools)
library(BiocManager)

BiocManager::install("msa")
devtools::install_bitbucket("Grantlab/bio3d-view")
```

**Q10.** Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?

msa

**Q11.** Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?:

bio3d-view

**Q12.** True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

TRUE

## Search and retreive ADK structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")

aa
```

**Q13.** How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e.Â how long is this sequence?

214

```{r}
# Blast or hmmer search 
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
# Plot a summary of search results
hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
head(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

## Align and superpose structures

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
# plot(pdbs, labels=ids, cex=0.5)
```

## Annotate collected PDB structures

```{r}
anno <- pdb.annotate(ids)
unique(anno$source)

anno
```

## Principal component analysis

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

# Optional further visualization

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```

Plot PCA results with ggplot

```{r}
#Plotting results with ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

df <- data.frame(PC1=pc.xray$z[,1], 
                 PC2=pc.xray$z[,2], 
                 col=as.factor(grps.rd),
                 ids=ids)

p <- ggplot(df) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=col, label=ids) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 20) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p
```

# Normal mode analysis

```{r}
# NMA of all structures
modes <- nma(pdbs)

plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```

**Q14.** What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

The black and colored lines are different. They differ most in around residue 50, 125 and 150.
